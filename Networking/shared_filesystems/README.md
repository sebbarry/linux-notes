Shared filesystems in this folder overview how networks should be configured within a local network. 

Multiple clients typically connects to a single server within the network. This server hosts multiple large files that acts as a shared drive for the network.

This section assumes that we have at least two servers. One to act as the shared common server and the other to act as the client.
