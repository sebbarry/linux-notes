This file overviews how to create users and manage them. This is a continuation of the first file previously written. 


- Every new user has its own /home/<user> directory
- The root user has its own /root directory

+----------------------------------------+


Creating a User (Generic): 
(only root can administer a new user)
command: useradd <username>

Creating a User (with a userid):
command: useradd -u <userid> <username>

Creating a User (with a comment about the user):
command: useradd -u <userid> -c "<comment>" <username>

Issuing a password to a User: 
(only root can administer a password)
command: passwd <username>

To see a password for a user: 
command: cat /etc/shadow | grep <username>
(:!!: means a password is not defined)

Switch to a User: 
command: su <username>

Get the ID and Information about the User: 
command: id <username>


Modifying a User: 
command: usermod ... <user>
example: usermod -c "this is the new comment for a user" <user>  (change the comm.)
example: usermod -u 1099 <user> (change a user's id)
(usermod --help for more tags to change)


Deleting a User: 
command: userdel <username>
