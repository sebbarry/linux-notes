chmod g<-+><xrw> <file/directory>

For users not in the group only: 
chmod o<-+><xrw> <file/directory>

chmod ugo<+-><xrw> <file/directory>

- To change the permissions using bits: 
each # represents a byte.
000 = no permissions
001 = x permission
011 = wx permission
.. 
chmod <###> <file/directory>

We can also use the t, and s bit character.

chmod u+s <file> will give the same permission of the user that owns the
directory.

cmod +t <file> will prevent new users from renaming any file owned by 
users of the same group.

- Default permissions when creating files or directory:
umask <####> 
**To keep the changes for the new umask, change the umask definition in: 
/etc/bashrc
/etc/profile
