Archiving: 

- Archiving is the process of collecting and storing a group of files into one file for easier portability and storage. We can collect and pack individual files into one place (one file).
- Overlooks multiple versions of the same file. Reduces storage space as well. 
- tar and star


Compression:

- logically reduces the size of the files so that they take less space on disk.
- either be lossy or lossless. Either has their own way of compressing on disk.
- gzip or bzip2
