all users accounts have: 
1. username
2. uid (user id)
3. default group
4. comments
5. shell. 
6. home directory location

All this information is stored in the etc/passwd file

====== etc/passwd file ======

username:password:UID:GID:comments:home_dir:shell

*The first listing in the etc/passwd file is the root account. 

=============================

- we can read passwords from the /etc/shadow file.
- the root account is always UID 0
- we can assign users to certain groups to make files.
- a user is always placed into the home directory.


====== etc/shadow file ========
contains a list of passwords 
-refer to an online resource for field partitions
===============================


======= creating a user =========

useradd [options] username

-c ('comment')
-m (create the home directory automatically)
-s <provide the path to the user's defualt shell.>
-r to create a system account (used to application and system accounts (think db account))
-d set the directory of the user manually (commonly when making a system account)
-g <default group name>
-G non default project.

useradd -c "sebastian barry" -m -s /bin/bash sebastian (to create a new user)
passwd sebastian (to enter a password)

=================================

-not every account is meant to be used by a person
-some accounts are created to run system processes, database processes, and other application processes.

** to create a system or application account make sure to set the shell as:
- /usr/sbin/nologin 
this is because we dont want the user to be able to login to the system using taht account.


========= delete an account ===========
userdel -r username
=======================================

========== change an account ==============
usermod 
===========================================

========= switching accounts ==============

su (switches to sudo account)
su <username> (switches to particular account)


===========================================


=============== managing group details ======

group details are found in the /etc/group file

groupname:password:GID:account1, ...accountn

show groups with: groups command 
groups <groupname>
show a user's group with: groups <user>

1. create a group: 
groupadd <name> 
2. delete a group: 
groupdel <name>
3. modify a group: 
groupmod [options] <namegroup>
-g <value> : change the group id  
-n <group> : rename the group 


=========== demo: create groups ==========

#make 3 groups
groupadd writers 
groupadd tv
groupadd movie
#show the last three lines of the /etc/group file
tail -3 /etc/group
#add a user to a particular group
useradd -c "User A" -g writers -G tv -m -s /bin/bash usr_a
#give the user a password
passwd usr_a 
#make a second user
useradd -c "User B" -g tv -G writers,movie -m -s /bin/bash usr_b
passwd usr_b

#check who belongs to what group
grep <gid> /etc/passwd
