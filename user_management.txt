all users accounts have: 
1. username
2. uid (user id)
3. default group
4. comments
5. shell. 
6. home directory location

All this information is stored in the etc/passwd file

====== etc/passwd file ======

username:password:UID:GID:comments:home_dir:shell

*The first listing in the etc/passwd file is the root account. 

=============================

- we can read passwords from the /etc/shadow file.
- the root account is always UID 0
- we can assign users to certain groups to make files.
- a user is always placed into the home directory.


====== etc/shadow file ========
contains a list of passwords 
-refer to an online resource for field partitions
===============================


======= creating a user =========

useradd [options] username

-c ('comment')
-m (create the home directory automatically)
-s <provide the path to the user's defualt shell.>
-r to create a system account (used to application and system accounts (think db account))
-d set the directory of the user manually (commonly when making a system account)
-g <default group name>
-G non default project.

useradd -c "sebastian barry" -m -s /bin/bash sebastian (to create a new user)
passwd sebastian (to enter a password)

=================================

-not every account is meant to be used by a person
-some accounts are created to run system processes, database processes, and other application processes.

** to create a system or application account make sure to set the shell as:
- /usr/sbin/nologin 
this is because we dont want the user to be able to login to the system using taht account.


========= delete an account ===========
userdel -r username
=======================================

========== change an account ==============
usermod 
===========================================
