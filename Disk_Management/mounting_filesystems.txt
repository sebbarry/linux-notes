This file overlooks the process for mounting file systems.

- We typically start by creating partitions on a disk the usual way using fdisk. 
- Once partitioned, we mount a file system for it.




There are two types of file systems: 
1. ext4
2. xfs





Display Available Information About Block Devices: 

command: blkid
Checking if a partition contains a file system: 
/dev/vda3: PARTUUID="..." 
(this does not contain a file system if there is no TYPE present or PARTUUID)





Creating a File System: 

command: mkfs -t <file system type> /dev/<partition>






Mounting a File System: 

We need to create directories in the /etc directory and change the fstab to reflect any changes.


command: cd /etc
command: mkdir <mount point name> (create the directory path for the MP)
command: vim /etc/fstab

Update the fsstab like so:
"""
LABEL or UUID                               Path            Type    ?        P#'s

UUID="6f104aac-bfcc-4b32-9884-0fde2ccd63c2" /etc/sda2_mp    ext4    defaults 0 1

"""

command: mount /etc/<mount point name> (mount the file system)


To List File Systems: 
command: df -h 


Unmounting A File System: 
command: umount <path to filesystem>
